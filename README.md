# 2D Arrays (Matrices) in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

A **2D array** in C++ is essentially an array of arrays, also referred to as a **matrix**. It allows storage and manipulation of tabular data in rows and columns. Matrices are widely used in mathematical computations, graphics, and data representation where elements are organized in a grid.

In C++, 2D arrays can be declared using:
```cpp
datatype arrayName[rows][columns];
```
**Common Operations on 2D Arrays
Matrix Addition â€“ Adding corresponding elements of two matrices
Matrix Subtraction
Matrix Multiplication
Transpose of a Matrix â€“ Flipping rows and columns
Finding Maximum/Minimum element
Diagonal Sum

**Applications of 2D Arrays
Representing mathematical matrices
Image processing (pixel representation)
Games like chess, tic-tac-toe, sudoku
Storing tables (e.g., marksheets, grids)
Dynamic programming (e.g., memoization tables)
Simulation of real-world grids/maps

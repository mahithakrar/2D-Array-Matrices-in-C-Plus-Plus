# 2D Arrays (Matrices) in C++

## 📌 Overview

A **2D array** in C++ is essentially an array of arrays, also referred to as a **matrix**. It allows storage and manipulation of tabular data in rows and columns. Matrices are widely used in mathematical computations, graphics, and data representation where elements are organized in a grid.

In C++, 2D arrays can be declared using:
```cpp
datatype arrayName[rows][columns];

⚙️ Common Operations on 2D Arrays
Matrix Addition – Adding corresponding elements of two matrices

Matrix Subtraction

Matrix Multiplication

Transpose of a Matrix – Flipping rows and columns

Finding Maximum/Minimum element

Diagonal Sum

Searching an Element in the Matrix
